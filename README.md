# ML-Linear-Regression

In this project, I take a look at a dataset of wine features and their respective quality.

###### Data Visualization and Analysis

I first perform data visualization and analysis to get a better understanding of the data. I look at a histogram of quality ratings, display distributions for wine density and alcohol content, create a jointplot of these two features, and display a pairwise correlation heatmap to see which features are highly correlated. 

###### Parametric Modeling

Three models were developed to predict wine quality based on features. One for linear regression, one for multilinear regression, and one for multilinear regression with interaction. 

###### Cross Validation 

Finally, the models were ran with cross validation to better understand what model performs best at each threshold.
