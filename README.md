# ML-Linear-Regression

The project focuses on analyzing a dataset containing wine features and their corresponding quality ratings.

###### Data Exploration and Visualization:
Initially, the dataset is explored through visualization and analysis. This involves examining the distribution of quality ratings using a histogram, exploring wine density and alcohol content distributions, creating a joint plot to understand their relationship, and generating a pairwise correlation heatmap to identify highly correlated features.

###### Model Development:
Three models are developed to predict wine quality based on its features: a linear regression model, a multilinear regression model, and a multilinear regression model with interaction terms.

###### Cross Validation:
Cross-validation is performed to assess the models' performance accurately across different evaluation thresholds.
